## General Information

Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a model that can detect melanoma in skin cancer images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma.

## Technologies Used

- Python - version 3.12.3
- Pandas - version 2.2.2
- Numpy - version 1.26.4
- Matplotlib - version 3.7.1
- Seaborn - version 0.13.2
- Tensorflow - version 2.12.0

## Conclusions

- The model is able to detect melanoma in skin cancer images with an accuracy of 86% on Test Data.
